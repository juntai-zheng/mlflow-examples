# How to Contribute
First, install requirements for running the linter via `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`

To contribute, make a PR that:
* Contains your new example app in a subdirectory
* Adds instructions on running your example app to the README
* Passes linting tests (run ./lint.sh from the root project directory)
